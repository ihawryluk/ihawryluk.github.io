Hi! I'm Iwona, a mathematical modeller and data scientist. Currently I'm working as a postdoctoral researcher at the Department of Infectious Disease Epidemiology at Imperial College London. I'm part of the [Machine Learning and Global Health network](https://mlgh.net/).

My work focuses on applications of modern Machine Learning and Statistical methods to various aspects on infectious disease modelling. In [my PhD thesis](https://github.com/ihawryluk/phd_thesis/blob/main/hawryluk_phd_thesis.pdf) I looked at developing statistical methods for chracterising the severity of emerging pathogen, with a special focus on COVID-19 pandemic.

Outside of academia I've worked as a Data Scientist in few different industries: working with clinical data and medical images for building decision support systems in hospitals, evaluating exposure risks for ingredients in cosmetics and food compounds, and applying Bayesian modelling in cybersecurity for detection of anomalous behaviours.
