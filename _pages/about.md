Hi! I'm Iwona, a mathematical modeller and data scientist with a PhD in Applied Statistics from Imperial College London. Currently I'm working as Data Scientist at the London Ambulance Service NHS Trust. I'm part of the [Machine Learning and Global Health network](https://mlgh.net/).

My academic work focused on applications of modern Machine Learning and Statistical methods to various aspects on infectious disease modelling. In [my PhD thesis,](https://github.com/ihawryluk/phd_thesis/blob/main/hawryluk_phd_thesis.pdf) I looked at developing statistical methods for characterising the severity of emerging pathogen, with a special focus on COVID-19 pandemic.

Outside of academia I've worked as a Data Scientist in few different industries: working with clinical data and medical images for building decision support systems in hospitals, evaluating exposure risks for ingredients in cosmetics and food compounds, and applying Bayesian modelling in cybersecurity for detection of anomalous behaviours.
